# Deploy to GitHub Pages

This is an old version - we should check this :\)

To deploy our changes to GitHub pages we will use the angular-cli-ghpages package [https://github.com/angular-buch/angular-cli-ghpages](https://github.com/angular-buch/angular-cli-ghpages)

* You need to have a GitHub user
* You need to create a repostiroy for your project.
* You need to commit all the changes you made in the project
* You need to install angular-cli-ghpages

## Creating a GitHub user

If you already have a GitHub user you can skip this step. To Create a GitHub user go to GitHub: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) Fill the regetration form and make sure to validate your email address.

## Create your App repository

After logging in to GitHub. Click on the `Start a project` button, and name the repository `ng-girls-todo` or any other name you like.

## Connecting your repository

Commit all your changes by runing this command in your project directory.

```text
git add -A && git commit -m "Your Message"
```

Run the following command to connect your code to your repository. make sure to replace the {YOUR\_USERNAME} and {YOUR\_REPO} with your github username and repository name.

```text
git remote add origin https://github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/{YOUR_REPO}.git
git push -u origin master
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

First install angular-cli-ghpages.

```text
npm i -g angular-cli-ghpages
```

Then simply run:

```text
ng build --prod --base-href="/[your-repo-name]/"
angular-cli-ghpages
```

Your app will be available at \[[https://\[your-GH-username\].github.io/\[repo-name\]\(https://\[your-GH-username\].github.io/\[repo-name\)\](https://[your-GH-username].github.io/[repo-name]%28https://[your-GH-username].github.io/[repo-name%29\)\]

For more information see [https://github.com/angular-buch/angular-cli-ghpages](https://github.com/angular-buch/angular-cli-ghpages).

## Known Issues

On \(windows\) machines you probably run into an issue like the following:

```text
An error occurred!
 Error: Unspecified error (run without silent option for detail)
    at C:\Users\<myuser>\AppData\Roaming\nvm\v8.9.1\node_modules\angular-cli-ghpages\node_modules\gh-pages\lib\index.js:232:19
    at _rejected (C:\Users\<myuser>\AppData\Roaming\nvm\v8.9.1\node_modules\angular-cli-ghpages\node_modules\q\q.js:844:24)
    ...
```

Try to debug it with `angular-cli-ghpages -S` . If you get the following error:

```text
fatal: could not read Username for \'https://github.com\': No error\n',
```

you can do the following

1. Create a Personal Access Token here: [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Run the following command and replace your token, organisation \(your user\), repository, username and email:

   ```text
   angular-cli-ghpages --repo=https://<personal-access-token>@github.com/organisation/your-repo.git --name="Displayed Username" --email=mail@example.org
   ```
